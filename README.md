# Bayesian-Variable-Selection-for-Ultrahigh-dimensional-Sparse-Linear-Models
This repository contains the codes for the project "Bayesian Variable Selection for Ultrahigh-dimensional Sparse Linear Models".  There are two files in the repository, 1) functions.R, 2) Applications.R. 
The file functions.R contains all necessary functions for the application of the two-stage algorithm proposed in this project. Each function contains a description of the same. 
The file Application.R demonstrates the two-stepped algorithm with an application.
